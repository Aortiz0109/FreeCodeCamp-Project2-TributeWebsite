        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mr. Borelli's Life:</h3>
        <hr class="timeline-hr">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1988</strong> - Born in Omaha, Nebraska</li>
          <li>
            <strong>2007</strong> - Bonnell enrolled at the University of Nebraska, Omaha, 
            where he studied music while working night shifts as a restaurant manager at a casino. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2010</strong> - Unable to juggle both his education and full-time work, 
            Bonnell dropped out of college. Soon after, he was fired from his restaurant position, 
            and found work as a carpet cleaner.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2011</strong> - Quit his job as a carpet cleaner to stream video games full-time. Streaming 
            his Starcraft II matches on livestream.com and ustream.tv,then Justin.tv (now Twitch), he was 
            immediately financially successful.In October of that year, Bonnell joined professional team Quantic 
            Gaming and placed 4th in the 2011 MLG Global North American invitational.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - Gained attention for live-streaming political debates with other internet personalities. 
            Subsequent journalistic and academic coverage of right-wing YouTube commentary has credited Bonnell 
            as an early and effective opposition to it, particularly owing to his provocative, combative debate 
            style which appeals to right-wing gaming audiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2017</strong> - Debated popular YouTuber Jon Jafari, better known as JonTron, on immigration and 
            assimilation in March 2017, after Jafari tweeted in support of anti-immigration statements by 
            Republican congressman Steve King.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2019</strong> - Bonnell and fellow streamer Trihex (Mychal Ramon Jefferson) premiered a political 
            commentary collaboration, The DT Podcast. The podcast streamed its final episode in October 2019, during 
            which Jefferson confronted Bonnell regarding statements the latter had made defending his use of offensive 
            humor—including racial slurs—in private
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> -  His Twitch partnership agreement would be terminated the following month for 
            "encouragement of violence". The termination came as a result of comments made on-stream after the 
            Kenosha unrest shooting, in which Bonnell expressed opposition to riots at the George Floyd protests. 
            Bonnell said that "the rioting needs to fucking stop, and if that means like white redneck fucking militia 
            dudes out there mowing down dipshit protesters that think that they can torch buildings at ten p.m., then 
            at this point they have my fucking blessing...
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2021</strong> - Debated Marxian economist Richard D. Wolff, with Bonnell defending capitalism. In 
            that debate, Bonnell described the label of "socialism" as poorly defined, and noted a history of famine 
            and abuses in countries like the Soviet Union and China, while Wolff responded by attempting to correct 
            perceived misrepresentations from Bonnell of his views on socialism throughout the debate.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2022</strong> - Was indefinitely banned from Twitch due to "hateful conduct". Dot Esports speculates 
            that this may have been due to Bonnell streaming with white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who had previously 
            been banned from the platform. Bonnell speculated that the ban reason may have been linked to his expressing 
            the view that "transwomen shouldn't compete with ciswomen in women's athletics".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2023</strong> - Bonnell, alongside other political streamers such as Vaush, Emma Vigeland (co-host of 
            The Majority Report with Sam Seder), and Keffals, interviewed U.S. Representative Ro Khanna about various topics, 
            including the importance of youth political participation and ways to push progressive political sentiment, as well 
            as asking questions about Khanna himself.
          </li>
          <li><strong>2024</strong> - Expressed interest in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. He has shown sympathy for Israel, 
          stating, "The Palestinians are oppressed by all the Arab countries, and no country from them, which is supposed to be 
          on 'their' side, has bothered to offer them a real solution – and yet, their anger is directed fully at Israel, and 
          unjustifiably in my opinion." Bonnell was scheduled to debate Norman Finkelstein on the matter, but it was postponed. 
          The following March, he appeared on the Lex Fridman Podcast in a debate with Norman Finkelstein, Benny Morris, and Mouin Rabbani.
